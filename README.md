Shortest Paths with Dijkstra's Algorithm is a fundamental project focused on solving one of the classic problems in graph theory. It revolves around the implementation and application of Dijkstra's algorithm, a widely used algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

This project delves into the core concept of computing the shortest path efficiently, enabling exploration of the optimal route from one node to another within a network of interconnected nodes and edges. It showcases how this algorithm efficiently calculates the shortest path, making it invaluable in various fields such as transportation networks, computer networks, and more.

By visualizing the graph and highlighting the paths, this project aids in understanding and demonstrating the inner workings of Dijkstra's algorithm. It not only provides a practical implementation but also serves as an educational tool for learning about graph algorithms and their real-world applications.

Through this project, users can interact with the algorithm, input their graph data, and observe how Dijkstra's algorithm identifies the shortest paths, making it an accessible and illustrative demonstration of this crucial algorithmic concept.
